        <p>I am a big fan of flowers and always get mine from a specific guy inside the city market so I was inspired to make a
        website where people could easily order flowers from him. User Research shows also that special events and occasions
        ignite excitement and thus florist businesses have been booming. In order to get a wide reach, business owners need
        online visibility and users need a quick and efficient way to make orders without the trouble of having to go physically
        to their local flower shops during their busy day-to-day lives. This product provides users with an easier way to access
        them while enhancing the user experience through visual design and smooth user flow to promote high conversion rates.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">The Opportunity</h3>
                <p>In the realm of floral commerce, local florists are grappling with a critical issue: inadequate online visibility.
                Meanwhile, consumers seek a streamlined solution for placing flower orders swiftly and effortlessly. Presently,
                competitor websites suffer from substantial drop-off rates, primarily due to fragmented user journeys that necessitate
                phone calls for order placement, devoid of visual aids. Furthermore, alternative platforms are plagued by overcrowding,
                resulting in information overload, heightened user error rates, and suboptimal system usability. Addressing these
                challenges is imperative to enhance the online presence of local florists and provide users with an intuitive ordering
                experience that fosters satisfaction and loyalty.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3 class="section-title">The Solution</h3>
                <p>To address these challenges, I designed a flower ordering website where users could easily access or order their flowers
                without getting to the physical location. This will enhance local florists online visibility thus giving them a
                competitive edge and expanding audience reach that also promotes seamless user experience, promoting high conversion
                rates and satisfaction among diverse users.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">User Flow Diagram</h3>
                <p>In the Flower City Website , the user flow begins with the Sign-Up process, where users are
                prompted to create an
                account by entering their basic information, such as name, email, and password, or by signing in
                using third-party
                authentication options like Google or Email. Once signed up, users proceed to the Home Screen,
                which presents popular products and the home page menu at the top that has links to:product
                page, about page, contact page and an option to sign out.
                    For users to add an item to cart they can click the CTA button showing 'View all products'
                    and be redirected to the prodcut page. On this page they can click on an item, view the item
                    details and add item to cart. Then proceed to the checkout page where they can verify the payment
                    method , complete payment and finally land on the thank you for your purchase page where they can
                    be redirected to the home page to restart the user journey.</p>

        <p>The secondary research showed that users did not like websites whose landing pages were overcrowded with information and
        images as they portrayed poor information architecture. Users also appreciated websites they could navigate back and
        forth easily and complete the checkout process without having to call the business owners. This allowed me to use and
        apply these findings to my own design to enhance user experience.

            Users responded well to the user flow as it was
        easy and simple to navigate through and were able to checkout successfully. The website allows users to go back to home
        page or keep browsing after completing an order. Accessibility was consistent in terms of font types and size and clear

        <h3 class="section-title">Takeaways & Future Considerations</h3>
        <p>During the usability study I conducted the common theme was that users found navigation to be smooth and easy and the
        flow from home page to checkout was very clear. I learned that accessibility is very important and thus made all fonts
        clear by arranging them in a hierarchical form. What I changed was the transitioning from one page to another to allow
        less time for time on task. In future projects, I would add two sections in the header to peak intrinsic interest in
        users and use more secondary colors in the background instead of a plain white to enhance visual design</p>
