                    <p>
                        As the Lead UI/UX Designer, I developed an internal bowling queue system to efficiently manage high-traffic
                        days at the Village Market mall's bowling alley. This system was created to streamline the booking process,
                        making it easier for staff to handle large client volumes, particularly during peak times such as public
                        holidays and weekends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key features include "notified/pending" status bars for tracking ticket information and clickable lane cards
                        for editing lane occupancy. The design adheres to WCAG guidelines, ensuring consistency and accessibility.
                        The project was completed within a week, from June 7th to June 14th, and was designed to be used by
                        administrators only, who were the target end users. The final product proved to be seamless, user-friendly,
                        accessible, and easy to use.

                                Due to the project’s tight timeline, a rapid prototyping approach was utilized to quickly iterate
                                and refine the design based on feedback. Initial wireframes were created to map out the user flow,
                                focusing on ease of use and quick navigation for the bowling alley staff. High-fidelity mockups
                                followed, which were crucial in visualizing the final product before development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The design process was centered around the end users—the administrators—ensuring that the interface
                                was intuitive and aligned with their daily tasks. The emphasis was on accessibility, following WCAG
                                guidelines to make the system usable for all staff members, regardless of any potential limitations.

                                able to view their reports per day based on how many bowlers there were in a day 
                                and the peak times.

                    <p>
                        Moving forward, a key improvement I would implement is adding a user journey from the sign-up process for
                        administrators. Given the time-sensitive nature of the project, the system was initially designed with the
                        assumption that all users were already logged in as administrators. However, introducing a sign-up and login
                        feature would enhance the system’s security and provide a more structured user experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, expanding the system's functionality to include detailed user profiles for each administrator
                        could further streamline operations by tracking individual performance and usage statistics. This would
                        provide valuable insights for management while improving the overall efficiency of the bowling alley
                        operations.
